This project is based on an early version by [@王子周棋洛](https://blog.csdn.net/m0_53321320?type=blog), which I have meticulously improved and expanded.

## Project Introduction

This project implements an interactive cyber hand-drawn envelope using just a few simple and understandable lines of `css` and `js`.

The project has taken mobile responsiveness into account, so it features a flexible, responsive layout.

The badge on the envelope was made using [appicon-forge](https://github.com/zhangyu1818/appicon-forge), an open-source project by @zhangyu1818. The closure effect is as follows:

## More Ideas

```js

if (your goddess does not know how to open a URL || you do not have a pretty domain) {

  You can deploy this web project and embed it into an `NFC 216` chip.

  The chip can be placed in a small item like a photo frame. That way, your goddess can simply

  tap the frame with her phone (especially iPhone users, as NFC is enabled by default on iPhones)

  and she will be able to see the cyber letter.

}

else {

  You can directly send the domain via WeChat to your goddess, telling her it's a mysterious code.

  This could still be a nice surprise.

  However, a friendly reminder:

  if (your domain is not registered) {

    register it first, or there will be a warning.

  }

  else if (your domain is not .com, .cn, or .top) {

    WeChat may not recognize it, and your goddess could be confused.

  }

  else {

    Wish you success.

  }

}
