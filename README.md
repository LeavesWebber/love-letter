## Project Introduction  



This project implements an interactive cyber hand-drawn envelope with just a few simple lines of `css` and `js`. The badge on the envelope is created using the open-source project [appicon-forge](https://github.com/zhangyu1818/appicon-forge). The effect when it is closed is as follows:

## Features  



- 🌟 Mobile Adaptation  

Responsive and adaptive layout is used to ensure a smooth experience on mobile devices.  



- 🌟 Colorful Anniversaries  

The top left corner of the envelope dynamically updates the number based on the anniversary you set.  



- 🌟 Loading Screen and Resource Preloading  

A simple loading screen is used, and all resources are preloaded with timeout handling, so you don't have to worry about the network speed of your friends who are on Mars.  



- 🌟 Smoothness Defined  

Fading in and out, smooth transitions, everything is silky;  

I painstakingly made the image transitions fade in and out crosswise, and the motion blur effect even makes animations that are only a few frames look smooth.  



- 🌟 Highly Extensible  

I’ve left some materials that can be replaced. Additionally, there are pre-made features that you can easily enable by uncommenting them.  

For the animation part, I used **Promise** and **callback functions** to address asynchronous programming issues, making it easy to add more animations later.  



## More Ideas  



`if` `(`Your goddess doesn't know how to open a URL `||` You don’t have a beautiful domain name`)` `{`  

You can deploy this web project and embed it into an **NFC 216** chip;  

The chip can be placed inside a photo frame 🖼 or other small items. Then, your goddess just needs to tap her phone (especially if she’s using an iPhone, which has NFC enabled by default),  

and she’ll be able to see this cyber letter.  

`}`  



`else` `{`  

You can directly send your domain name to your goddess via WeChat and tell her it’s a mysterious code,  

which will still be a pleasant surprise 🎁.  

However, a friendly reminder:  

`if` `(`Your domain is not registered in China( also known ad '备案' in Chinese `)` `{`  

You’ll need to [register it](https://beian.miit.gov.cn/) first to guarantee the accessibility in Chinese mainland, or there might be a warning ❎;  

`}`  



`else if` `(`Your domain isn't one of the common domains like .com, .cn, or .top`)` `{`  

WeChat might not recognize it, and your goddess could be confused 💢;  

`}`  



`else`  

Good luck to you!
